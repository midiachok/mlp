        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <h2>Diligence</h2>
        <p>Applejack is a brave, reliable, strong, mature, and hard-working pony, though she can be headstrong about doing things on her own. In the episode Applebuck Season, she insists on tackling the annual apple harvest all by herself while her brother Big McIntosh recovers from an injury, repeatedly refusing Twilight Sparkle's offers of assistance before extreme exhaustion eventually compels her to accept. Later, in the episode The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000, she shows more readiness to receive help from her friends when they work together to outpace Flim and Flam in a cider-making contest.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Apple Family Reunion, when Granny Smith gives the job of hosting the reunion to Applejack, she is determined to host as many activities as she can so they can create many good memories. However, despite her good intentions, Applejack becomes too caught up in her planning to realize that the most important thing about the reunion is to bond with your family. Eventually, she learns her lesson, and brings the family back together to rebuild the demolished barn.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Mannerisms</h2>
        <img src="../images/apple1.png" alt="twilight" class="image1"/>
        <p>Applejack speaks with a Southern American accent, a thick southern drawl, similar to the accent of the southwestern Missouri and Oklahoma Ozarks, where there are a great number of apple orchards. In numerous episodes, she refers to members of her friends and family as "sugarcube" as a sign of affection.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Applejack dislikes things that are "girly" and "fancy", like the froufrou dresses in Suited For Success. Applejack describes in a flashback in The Cutie Mark Chronicles how she tried being a pony of elegance for a short time as a young filly by moving to Manehattan to live with her Aunt and Uncle Orange, but she ultimately decided to return to the farm after she realized that she was homesick and found it hard to fit in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She almost always wears a light brown stetson hat, which she usually removes before sleeping. She is the only one of the six main characters to keep her mane and tail tied back in a "ponytail". Applejack takes great pride in her hat and seldom goes anywhere without it. In the episode A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2 she hastily puts on her hat over her headband while Rarity is busy crying for Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Stubbornness and giving in</h2>
        <p>Applejack is occasionally very stubborn and inflexible, causing her to be hostile toward others or incapable of seeing alternate solutions to a problem.</p>
        <img src="../images/apple2.png" alt="twilight" class="image2"/>
        <p>However, Twilight can lose her cool under stress. In Swarm of the Century, she hysterically suggests building a replica of Ponyville in less than a minute before Princess Celestia can see the damage done by the parasprite infestation. In Lesson Zero, Twilight goes crazy in her attempt to write to Celestia about a friendship problem, to the point of deciding to create a problem herself. In The Crystal Empire - Part 1, she shows a desperate desire to pass a test that Celestia gives her. In The Beginning of the End - Part 1, she hyperventilates after being told that she will become ruler of Equestria after Celestia and Luna retire. In The Summer Sun Setback, she puts her whole craziness aside in order to make preparations for the final Summer Sun Celebration and her future role as ruler of Equestria. In A Trivial Pursuit, she is so desperate to win a trivia competition that she overrides Pinkie's enjoyment of the game.</p>
        <p>In Look Before You Sleep, she lets her feud with Rarity ruin Twilight Sparkle's sleepover; and in Fall Weather Friends, she allows herself to become just as underhanded as Rainbow Dash in her attempt to win. In both of these situations, she eventually lets go of her pride and is the first to apologize. She is quick to argue with Rainbow Dash in Over a Barrel, worsening the tension between the residents of Appleloosa and the buffalo.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Empathy and care</h2>
        <img src="../images/apple3.png" alt="twilight" class="image2"/>
        <p>Applejack is often shown to be one of the more empathetic members of the main cast, putting the needs and feelings of others before her own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In The Ticket Master, Applejack states that her reason for wanting to attend the Grand Galloping Gala is so she can sell enough treats to buy a replacement hip for Granny Smith. In Dragonshy, despite the other ponies' impatience (with the exception of Pinkie Pie) with Fluttershy, Applejack is willing to take the long way around the mountain with her in order to help her up. Applejack is also the first to notice Twilight Sparkle's glumness in A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1, and she is the only one to apologize for not listening to her in A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2. In Sleepless in Ponyville she is the only pony who notices that Scootaloo is abnormally nervous and jumpy. In Castle Sweet Castle, she is the one to suggest uprooting the Golden Oak Library's roots and making a castle chandelier for Twilight. In Brotherhooves Social, Applejack attempts to talk to Big McIntosh about what put him in a sour mood before being called away.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Honesty</h1>
        <img src="../images/apple4.png" alt="twilight" class="image1"/>
        <p>Applejack represents the element of honesty. Twilight Sparkle deduces this in Friendship is Magic, part 2, explaining that Applejack demonstrated her honesty when they faced their challenges against Nightmare Moon. Applejack finds it difficult to go against her natural honesty in Party of One when she has to lie about why she cannot attend Gummy's after-birthday party. She sweats and grins nervously under Pinkie Pie's scrutiny despite having the most credible excuse: needing to buck apples.</p>
        <p>The limits of Applejack's honesty are put to the test in Leap of Faith. When Flim and Flam sell their placebo potion to Granny Smith, Applejack endorses the product, while knowing it is a fake, because it visibly makes Granny Smith feel happier. Once the placebo effect leads Granny Smith to attempt a dangerous dive, she turns honest about the product. Her honesty rubs off on Silver Shill for the product, who comes to realize he had been helping to deceive other ponies.</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>Applejack possesses incredible physical strength due to, as she explains in Fall Weather Friends, years of applebucking, the practice of harvesting apple trees by kicking them to knock the apples down</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Athleticism</h2>
        <img src="../images/apple5.png" alt="twilight" class="image1"/>
        <p>Applejack possesses extraordinary athletic abilities. She and Rainbow Dash compete in the Iron Pony competition in Fall Weather Friends, where their athletic feats draw a sizable crowd. Applejack demonstrates her skills with a lasso in several episodes and in My Little Pony The Movie.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>Pinkie Pie describes Applejack as "one of the best bakers ever" in Applebuck Season. Applejack sells apple-based foods at a concession stand in The Best Night Ever. In an earlier episode, Applejack describes to Twilight how she will use the money from the concession stand to upgrade the barn roof, buy a new plow for Big McIntosh, and replace Granny Smith's hip. In A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1, Princess Celestia asks Applejack to prepare refreshments and the wedding cake for Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's royal wedding.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Playing musical instruments</h2>
        <p>Applejack demonstrates an affinity for playing musical instruments throughout the series. In A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2, she plays a fiddle during the picture montage in Love is in Bloom. In Pinkie Apple Pie, she plays a banjo during Apples to the Core. In Somepony to Watch Over Me, she plays a snake charming flute to save Apple Bloom from a chimera. In a flashback in The Mane Attraction, she accompanies Coloratura on the acoustic guitar during a camp talent show. In a flashback or fantasy in Twilight's Seven, Applejack's alter ego Apple Chord is a talented, and later very famous, guitar player.</p>
